Exempel manus:

Thank you Isak for the very nice presentation, I really liked how you
 presented/explained X.

Qs:
1. When you talked about X, you mentioned that ... I am curious about what
   ... 

2. You mentioned that Na does not intercalate effectively in graphite, 
   however you showed that Na could intercalte in graphite sheets in Hard Carbon.
   Could you elaborate on that?

3. WAXS peak other than the one showed; what does it mean?

4. You mentioned three types of Na storage mechanisms in hard carbon. You talked
   mostly about the pore filling and intercalation, and not so much about surface adsorption.
   Can that mechanism be studied using SAXS/WAXS, or would you need another experimental
   approach for that? 

5.
